# Human Pose Evaluator

## Overview

This Human Pose Evaluator is a sophisticated tool developed to analyze human poses through images or videos. It integrates cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies, utilizing OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for accurate pose estimation, and a custom GUI for enhanced user interaction. The tool is designed to calculate joint angles and evaluate posture, providing critical feedback for applications in fitness coaching, physical therapy, and personal posture improvement.

## How It Works

### Pose Estimation
- The system uses MediaPipe, a state-of-the-art pose estimation library, to detect human figures in images or videos accurately. It identifies key landmarks on the human body, such as joints and extremities, to analyze posture and movement.

### Angle Calculation
- Once landmarks are identified, the application calculates angles between major joints. This information is crucial for assessing the alignment and balance of the pose. Angle calculation algorithms take into account the three-dimensional positions of each landmark to provide precise angle measurements.

### GUI Interface
- A tkinter-based GUI allows users to interact with the application easily. Users can upload images or videos for analysis, view real-time feedback on their posture, and adjust settings or thresholds for a personalized evaluation experience.

### Data Visualization
- The application leverages Matplotlib for generating visual representations of the pose analysis. It plots joint angles over time, providing users with a clear understanding of their posture dynamics during different exercises or movements.

### Customizable Evaluation
- Users can customize evaluation criteria based on specific needs or objectives. This feature makes the tool versatile across different use cases, from rehabilitation exercises to performance analysis in sports.
